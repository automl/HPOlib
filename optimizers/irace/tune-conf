## Configuration for Iterated Race (iRace).

# path = HPOlib/optimizers/irace/
## To use the default value of a parameter of iRace, simply do not set
## the parameter (comment it out in this file, and do not give any
## value on the command line).

## File that contains the description of the parameters.
# parameterFile <- "./parameters"
# parameterFile <- "../irace_1_06-dev/params.pcs"

## Directory where the programs will be run.
execDir <- "./"

## File to save tuning results as an R dataset, either absolute path
## or relative to execDir.
logFile <- "./irace.Rdata"

## Folder where tuning instances are located, either absolute or
## relative to working directory.
#instanceDir <- "./Instances"

## File with a list of instances and (optionally) parameters.
## If empty or NULL, does not use a file.
instanceFile <- NULL

## A file containing a list of initial candidates.
## If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# candidatesFile <- ""

## The script called for each candidate that launches the program to be tuned.
## See templates/hook-run.tmpl
hookRun <- "./hook-run"

## Optional R function to provide custom parallelization of hook.run.
## The signature of this function should be 'function(candidates,
## hook.run, instance, extra.params, config)' where 'candidates' is a
## list of candidates, hook.run is an R function and the rest are
## parameters to hook.run (see hook.run.default)
# hookRunParallel <- NULL

## Optional script that provides a numeric value for each candidate.
## See templates/hook-evaluate.tmpl
# hookEvaluate <- ""

## The maximum number of runs (invocations of hookRun) that will performed. It
## determines the (maximum) budget of experiments for the tuning, unless
## timeBudget is positive.
# maxExperiments <- 500

## The maximum computation time that should be used for tuning in
## seconds. This only works when tuning for time. 0 means no time
## limit (use maxExperiments).
# timeBudget <- 0

## An estimation of the average time in seconds required for one
## experiment. Only required if timeBudget is positive.
# timeEstimate <- 0

## Indicates the number of decimal places to be considered for the
## real parameters.
# digits <- 3

## A value of 0 silences all debug messages. Higher values provide
## more verbose debug messages.
debugLevel <- 1

## Number of iterations of Race. Do not use something else than the
## default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly what
## you are doing.
# nbIterations <- 0

## Number of experiments per iteration. Do no use something else than
## the default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly
## what you are doing.
# nbExperimentsPerIteration <- 0

## Sample the instances or take them always in the same order.
# sampleInstances <- 1

## Specifies the statistical test type: F-test or t-test.
# testType <- "F-test"

## Specifies how many instances are seen before the first elimination
## test. It must be a multiple of eachTest.
# firstTest <- 5

## Specifies how many instances are seen between elimination tests.
# eachTest <- 1

## The minimum number of candidates that should survive to continue one
## iteration. Do not use something else than the default (that is, the
## dynamic value) unless you know exactly what you are doing.
# minNbSurvival <- 0

## The number of candidates that should be sampled and evaluated at
## each iteration. Do no use something else than
## the default (that is, the dynamic value) unless you know exactly
## what you are doing.
# nbCandidates  <- 0

## This value is used to determine the number of candidates
## to be sampled and evaluated at each iteration. Use
## the default unless you know exactly what you are doing.
# mu <- 5

## Seed of the random number generator (must be a positive integer, NA
## means use a random seed).
# seed <- NA

## Number of calls to hookRun to execute in parallel. Less than 2
# means calls to hookRun are sequentially executed.
# parallel <- 0

## Enable/disable SGE cluster mode. Use qstat to wait for
## cluster jobs to finish (hookRun must invoke qsub).
# sgeCluster <- 0

## Enable/disable MPI. Use MPI to execute hookRun in parallel
## (parameter parallel is the number of slaves).
# mpi <- 0

## Enable/disable a soft restart strategy to avoid premature convergence 
## of the probabilistic model.
# softRestart <- 1

## Confidence level for the elimination test.
# confidence <- 0.95

## Previously saved log file to recover the execution of irace, either
## absolute path or relative to the current directory. If empty or
## NULL, recovery is not performed.
# recoveryFile <- ""

## File containing a list of logical expressions that cannot be true
## for any evaluated candidate. If empty or NULL, do not use a file.
# forbiddenFile <- ""
